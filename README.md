My Codeforces Practice Dump 👨‍💻
=================================

Just keeping track of my Codeforces problem solutions here. Nothing fancy, just a personal log to stay motivated!

🎯 Why I'm doing this
---------------------

*   Keeping myself accountable
    
*   Tracking progress over time
    
*   Having a place to look back at old solutions
    
*   Trying to solve a few problems each week
    

🚀 What's next
--------------

Gonna try to:

*   Add more problems regularly
    
*   Maybe tackle some medium-difficulty ones
    
*   Keep the streak going!
    

_Just practicing, one problem at a time ✨_
